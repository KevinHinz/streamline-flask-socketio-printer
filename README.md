# Installation

## Python 3

#### Mac OS
You need Python 3 to be installed along PIP. There is a good explanation from [John Lockwood](https://codesolid.com/installing-pyenv-on-a-mac/).

#### Windows OS
Run `python` in teh command line to check for a Python install. 
- If Python is not installed, Windows Store will open and offer an opportunity to install Python directly.
- If Python is installed it will launch and return the version; enter `quit()` to exit and proceed with the PIP install commands as listed below.
